        Another change is coming into effect for two of the world’s largest social media platforms – Facebook and Instagram. This time though, it will primarily affect advertisers. The social network announced that users who have not linked their Facebook and Instagram in the Accounts Center will be counted as two separate entities for ad purposes. So, if your accounts are not linked, the social network will assume that one user’s Instagram and Facebook profiles (even if they’re under the same email address) are actually two different users.

Facebook introduced Accounts Center in September 2020, which is located in Instagram’s, Messenger’s, and Facebook’s settings. It allows users to connect their accounts, enabling features such as cross-posting content, a single login credential, Facebook pay, and much more. Because of these functions, many users have synchronized their accounts. Advertisers will still see these users, who have opted into connecting their accounts, as one entity.

    This change may cause Facebook’s ad reach numbers to look better, though they say it should not have a significant impact on campaign reach because they’ve altered its Potential Reach estimates to be displayed in ranges instead of specific numbers. This change was made as Facebook faced legal challenges with fake and duplicate accounts in their approximations.
